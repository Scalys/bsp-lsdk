# TrustBox BSP

This BSP is based on 1903 release of NXP LSDK and relies on the LSDK sources archive available on NXP website (see [link](https://www.nxp.com/support/developer-resources/run-time-software/linux-software-and-development-tools/layerscape-software-development-kit-v19.03:LAYERSCAPE-SDK)).

To compose the BSP download the LSDK sources archive flexbuild_lsdk1903.tgz, place it in this directory next to construct.sh and run:
```
$ ./construct.sh
```

Then follow the build instructions described in the [build guide](https://www.grapeboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Scalys_Grapeboard-bsp-user-guide_18102018.pdf).
